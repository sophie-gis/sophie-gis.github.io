			["A","","<p>Aziraphale had always preferred the quiet, or at least the semblance of it. Whenever he listened to his records, it was usually just loud enough to drown out the noise from the street and soft enough to ignore at will as he read his books. (Sound masking, the humans called it. Truly they came up with the most wondrous things.)</p><p>He didn't need the music now, not in the upper bedroom with the street so far below, and not with Gabriel spread out on his back beneath Aziraphale and wearing a leather muzzle strapped tight but neat over both nose and mouth. The straps disappeared into the waves of Gabriel's hair, grown into long curls in the six months since he'd arrived like this on the bookshop's doorstep, wearing nothing but the muzzle and holding a cardboard box to cover his unformed Effort. Aziraphale's Soho neighbors still haven't stopped talking about it. What a scandal, they'd thought; they hadn't known the half of it.</p><p>\"Don't touch the leather,\" Crowley had warned as soon as he laid eyes on the muzzle. Aziraphale had agreed, once he'd skimmed the letter they'd found inside the otherwise-empty box. Apparently, Gabriel had been caught plotting to assassinate them both, and as a peace offering Heaven and Hell had decided to give them the now-former Supreme Archangel to use as they saw fit. The muzzle had been cured in hellfire and embossed with sigils that restricted all of Gabriel's miracles, save for ones necessary to keep his corporation alive&mdash;Beelzebub's work, with the new Supreme Archangel Michael signing off.</p><p>\"We can do anything we want, eh?\" Crowley had said. He'd had the same look as when he'd offered Aziraphale the ox ribs all those years ago in Job's cellar. Now that he knew what that look meant, Aziraphale had found himself excited to see what Crowley would suggest this time. And he hadn't been disappointed.</p><p>Aziraphale rose from the bed now, sliding off of Gabriel's spent Effort, and stretched languidly. Oh, it really had been such a wonderful idea to try these different human activities with Gabriel. He had never felt so relaxed, so clear-headed, as in those moments after they finished coupling like this.</p><p>Crowley always did have the best ideas.</p><p>He miracled them both clean and dry, then nudged Gabriel's chin until their eyes met. \"Thank you,\" Aziraphale said, as heartfelt as he always was after these sessions, and patted Gabriel on the cheek. \"I do hope it was as pleasant for you as it was for me.\"</p><p>He noticed a few tears spilling from Gabriel's eyes, and Aziraphale gently dabbed them away with one of his own soft handkerchiefs. It was good to see that their activities had moved Gabriel so, either in joy or in regret for what he'd tried to do to them. Perhaps that meant there was hope for him yet, that someday he would fully repent and the miracles restraining him could be loosened and the three of them could&mdash;</p><p>Well. Best not to get ahead of himself. Aziraphale buttoned up his trousers and waistcoat, tucked the damp handkerchief into the pocket of his shop jacket, and slipped out of the room where Crowley was leaning against the wall and waiting for him.</p><p>\"He's all yours, my dear. I made sure not to tire him out this time, so he should be perfectly ready for you.\"</p><p>\"Nnn. Not mine, angel.\" Crowley sauntered close enough to brush a light kiss onto Aziraphale's temple. \"Ours. Just like everything else is.\"</p><p>\"Oh! Oh, I suppose that's true.\" Aziraphale chuckled. \"We both get plenty of use out of him, don't we?\" And with that, the angel wandered downstairs to the shop to pick up the Austen he was halfway through rereading, his head clearer than it had been all week and his heart fluttering from both the kiss and the glowing realization of just how much he now shared with Crowley. It was more than he had ever dreamed possible. It was, in short, the Heaven he'd always wanted.</p><p>The demon, meanwhile, slid into the bedroom as easily as he'd once slithered into an apple tree, then snapped his fingers. The Hell-made muzzle responded to him as it always had, and the leather turned transparent just in time to reveal Gabriel's teeth bared in a grimace of hate at the doorway.</p><p>\"Not very angelic of you,\" Crowley mused. Another snap, and his trousers melted into his skin, leaving him bare and far more erect than Gabriel. \"Guess I shouldn't be surprised. So! Have you learned your lesson yet, O Holy Supreme Archangel?\"</p><p>This time, when Gabriel's eyes filled with tears, Crowley knew what they were for. He was a demon, after all, and unlike Aziraphale he had no illusions about the darker things in life. These were tears of shame, of despair, of helpless rage. And because Crowley had always preferred honesty over silence, he heard what Gabriel sobbed beneath his muzzle that Aziraphale had not. \"You&mdash;damn it all, you fucking Fallen piece of trash, how dare you touch me, <em>unleash me at once!</em>\"</p><p>\"Mmm, thought not.\" Crowley tugged and rolled Gabriel into the correct position, ignoring the cries of the angel on the bed as Crowley manipulated his body in other ways to prepare him for what was to come. (Meanwhile, the angel downstairs heard the muffled sounds and put on a Shostakovich record&mdash;Aziraphale's own sort of preparation.) \"Unfortunate, really, since there's an escape clause on that collar of yours if you'd just admit that you were wrong.\"</p><p>\"I'm not wrong,\" Gabriel snarled, \"and you're lying.\"</p><p>\"Well, I <em>am</em> a demon. Comes with the territory. But enough talk.\" Crowley leaned in close as he lined his Effort up to Gabriel's exposed hole and savored the shudders Gabriel made at Crowley's breath on his cheek. \"I think it's time for you to <em>shut your stupid mouth and take it already.</em>\"</p><p>Gabriel screamed out a prayer, but the muzzle had swallowed him up once more.</p>"],
			["B","","<p>\"I really don't like your office.\"</p><p>Raphael leaned against the wall as he made this statement. Gabriel didn't even look up from his paperwork. </p><p>\"Why not?\" His tone was patient, even. He knew that the other archangel was just being bratty and it wouldn't do to let Raphael stir him up so early in the afternoon. </p><p>Raphael always had one thing or another to say-- he hated the bureaucratic and stuffy nature of Heaven these days, which made sense given that in the Beginning, he had been elected to create the stars and open sky. Going from that to sitting in a tall skyrise to nowhere for eternity was enough to put anyone in a near-constant state of grumpiness. </p><p>Gabriel still loved him all the same. </p><p>Raphael grumbled, \"How do you get anything done with this much stuff on the desk? Why do you even need a paperweight?\" </p><p>Amused, Gabriel snorted. He signed a sheet with a flourish and tucked it away in one of his many manilla folders. Turning to the redheaded angel, he smirked. \"You complain so much about my office, love, but we both get plenty of use out of it. You didn't have anything to say about my desk yesterday afternoon.\"</p><p>Raphael flushed scarlet. \"Whatever,\" he mumbled. \"Just call the Principality in.\"</p><p>\"Aziraphale, enter.\"</p><p>\"A-Archangels.\"</p><p>\"Sit.\"</p><p>Gabriel watched the Principality with an expression that was intentionally bored. He watched Aziraphale squirm under his gaze and Gabriel pointedly did <em>not</em> look at Raphael. It wouldn't do to see his partner's smug grin. This whole thing had been Raphael's idea. He'd been quite taken with Aziraphale for some time now, and when he had heard that Aziraphale was one of Gabriel's employees, he had all but begged for a chance to get his hands on the blond. Gabriel didn't understand the appeal, not entirely. Yet, as those blue eyes stared at him with undisguised apprehension, he felt a familiar stirring in his loins. </p><p>Grudgingly, he could admit this seemed as if it was going to be fun.</p><p>\"Raphael here told me that you were giving him trouble during a corporation inspection.\"</p><p>Aziraphale's gaze flitted to Raphael. He began to wring his hands. \"I...h-he was touching me.\"</p><p>Gabriel frowned, raising his eyebrows. \"An inspection typically involves touching, sunshine.\"</p><p>\"No!\" Aziraphale exclaimed, shaking his head. Then, he froze and began to ramble, \"I mean, he was. It wasn't appropriate-\"</p><p>\"<em>What </em>wasn't appropriate?\"</p><p>When Aziraphale didn't immediately answer, stammering, Gabriel doubled down, \"Are you trying to tell the archangel how to do his job? Tell him what he can and cannot do during his inspections?\"</p><p>Aziraphale paled. \"I'm- I'm sorry. I didn't mean any disrespect.\" The Principality hunched in his seat, keeping his eyes low.</p><p>Gabriel was used to a bit of bite. Raphael was always ready to bicker and provoke. Aziraphale, on the other hand...had simply submitted. Never had it occurred to him to use his power like this. It was wrong. So deliciously wrong. It was easy and Aziraphale was pathetic and Gabriel had never been harder. </p><p>\"Chill, Gabriel.\" Right. Raphael wanted this to be <em>his</em> show. Gabriel sat back. To Aziraphale, the other archangel said, \"It's fine. S'not like I was on a tight schedule or anything.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" Aziraphale replied weakly.</p><p>Raphael shrugged dismissively. \"I'm sure you are. But you ran out of your last inspection. It's gotta be done sooner rather than later. Now like I mentioned, I'm busy, but Gabriel was kind enough to arrange this time for our appointment.\"</p><p>Aziraphale's head shot up, mouth gaping. \"What?\"</p><p>It was obvious to Gabriel that Raphael was fighting off a grin. He doubted that Aziraphale would even think to look for such a thing. \"<em>Mm</em>yep. So, gonna need you to stand up and strip your robes.\"</p><p>\"But...G-Gabriel-\" </p><p>Gabriel stood up as Raphael moved in. \"Aziraphale, are you being disobedient? You heard him.\"</p><p>\"Don't got all day, angel,\" Raphael added. \"Some of us have lots of work to do because <em>others </em>of us failed to protect a garden.\"</p><p>Aziraphale was silent for a moment. Then he got to his feet and began doing as directed. His hands were trembling so much that it took him much longer than it should have to do such a simple task. His corporation was soft and curvy, chest and legs dusted with light blond hair. Dusky pink nipples hardened in the sudden chill. His Effort was a limp, average-sized cock, nestled in a bush of light curls. \"Sorry,\" he apologized. He sounded miserable, on the verge of tears.</p><p>Gabriel surreptitiously readjusted his trousers. Raphael outright grinned, amber eyes twinkling.</p><p>\"Alright. Let's start.\"<br><br>Just another thing they would get plenty of use out of.</p>"],
			["C","","<p>\"A little bird has walked into my den. Whatever shall I do with it?\"</p><p>The serpent lounges on a large sofa, his long legs arranged in a way that highlights his effort. </p><p>Aziraphale swallows, his mouth dry, as he moves cautiously toward the demon.</p><p>\"I've been sent to negotiate,\" Aziraphale announces confidently. </p><p>The demon cocks an eyebrow at him, interest shining in his yellow eyes. He rakes his gaze over Heaven's envoy, a predator appraising his prey, causing the angel's feathers to bristle in another dimension.</p><p>\"I am here to discuss your nefarious activities in the area and-\"</p><p>\"Won't you sit down? If we are to negotiate, you may as well be comfortable.\"</p><p>Aziraphale finds himself stumbling a few feet forward into an armchair next to the demon. </p><p>The serpent snaps two glasses and a bottle of red wine into existence. He stands gracefully, all long limbs and swagger as he grabs the bottle and pours them both a healthy dose of alcohol. </p><p>Aziraphale looks at the glass offered to him but makes no move to take it.</p><p>\"Relax, angel. Here, have a taste.\"</p><p>The demon edges closer, perching himself on the armrest, one arm resting on the back of the chair, the other holding the glass to Aziraphale's lips.</p><p>Aziraphale looks up into Crowley's serpentine eyes, unsure but fascinated. </p><p>\"Open.\" the tempter whispers.</p><p>Aziraphale obeys, parting his lips as the demon tips the glass. He lets the tart taste coat his tongue before swallowing. </p><p>\"Good.\" The demon murmurs, his breath tickling Aziraphale's ear. </p><p>Aziraphale fingers his bowtie, trying to loosen it while considering how to take back control of the situation.</p><p>\"Now, tell me why you're here.\"  A forked tongue brushes against his earlobe, sending a shiver through Aziraphale, who tries to maintain his composure.</p><p>\"I brought paperwork for you to sign. Gabriel will be expecting me soon.\" Aziraphale congratulates himself on not sounding as flustered as he feels.</p><p>The air is stifling, his mind foggy, and he can't think of a single reason to object when instead of answering, the demon pushes his shirt collar aside to press kisses onto his neck. A hand slides into his hair and tugs gently at the curls to expose his throat further. The angel's eyes close as a moan builds in his throat. Fangs graze his skin, snapping him back to his senses.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" he asks, distressed, as he tries to detangle himself from the serpent.</p><p>\"Oh angel,\" Crowley says softly, sounding genuinely sorry. \"They didn't send you to negotiate.\" He leans closer and whispers the last few words directly into his ear. \"They've sent me an <em>offering.</em>\"</p><p>Aziraphale's eyes widen in shock. </p><p>\"No!\" He jumps up, knocking the glass from Crowley's hand, its contents splattering on both the demon and the floor. Aziraphale runs to the door, snapping his fingers desperately. Despite his efforts, the locked door doesn't budge.</p><p>\"Open, you blasted thing!\" Adrenaline pumps faster in his human body, sending his heart thundering against this chest.</p><p>\"I'm afraid your powers won't work here. I should have mentioned it. My apologiesss.\"</p><p>He takes a long sip from his own glass, looking unapologetic as he waves the mess on the carpet and himself into the ether. </p><p>Aziraphale pauses, turning away from the door to face the demon fully. He adjusts his waistcoat in a practised gesture to centre himself. \"I think maybe we should postpone this meeting.\"</p><p>Crowley laughs as he stands up and sits back in the centre of the sofa, empty glass dangling from his elegant fingers.</p><p>\"Come here.\" </p><p>\"I really think that we-\" </p><p>\"Now.\"</p><p>Again, Aziraphale finds himself obeying the command. Before he can reach Crowley however, panic overruns the demon's powers, and sends the angel running blindly into the apartment, snapping his fingers a few more times in desperation.</p><p>Crowley stands languidly and stretches, walking slowly towards the fleeing angel.</p><p>\"Is that how we are doing it then?\" he chuckles darkly.</p><p>The apartment is quiet, and Crowley savours the hunt. He hovers by the bedroom door, tasting the air with his forked tongue. A whiff of ozone leads him to his office instead. He barely enters the room when something slams into his back. Crowley takes a second to appreciate how strong the principality is even without miracles as the angel tries to wrestle him to the floor. It doesn't matter though. A snap of his fingers has the angel losing his footing, and Crowley easily reverses their positions. He pushes the angel none too gently forward until he collides with his desk. Crowley pins him there with an arm pressed between his shoulders.</p><p>\"Calm down.\" He huffs, struggling to restrain the principality.</p><p>Aziraphale thrashes in his grip, managing to hit Crowley's temple with the back of his head. Crowley grits his teeth.</p><p> \"That wasn't very nice now, was it?\" There is an edge to the demon's voice that sends a chill of dread travelling up Aziraphale's spine. </p><p>The angel struggles under him, trying to push himself upright. Crowley snakes a hand into his blond curls and pushes his head back firmly against the desk. </p><p>\"Stop that.\"</p><p>\"You can't keep me here!\"</p><p>\"Let me explain your situation,\" he growls, tightening his grip. \"You are a diplomatic gift, and it would be rude to refuse it. You are going to be a good little angel and do what you're told, and in exchange I'll take good care of you. Do we have a deal?\"</p><p>Crowley drapes himself over Aziraphale more fully, the bulge of his cock brushing against Aziraphale's arse. He licks a strip of skin on the angel's neck.</p><p>\"Delicioussss.\" </p><p>The angel whimpers as Crowley snakes a hand around him and finds him equally hard. Aziraphale is mortified as the demon chuckles above him. </p><p>\"There is no need for shame, angel. We'll both get plenty of use out of it, won't we?\"</p><p>Aziraphale exhales shakily, unable to escape the demon's hold.</p><p>\"We are going to have such a lovely time, you and I.\"</p>"],
			["D","","<p>The bright lights of Heaven left Aziraphale squinting as they stepped off the elevator. The demon on the leash behind him had his eyes downcast, no doubt hiding from the light as well. Aziraphale could see the nervous tension in the lines of his shoulders, but he wasn't worried. He knew his demon was well-trained; he would behave himself.</p><p>The black robe that Aziraphale had given him to wear was sheer enough that he could see the outline of the lithe body underneath. It was interesting. There was just something about Crowley. It didn't seem to matter how many times Aziraphale had used his body, the angel was always hungry for more.</p><p>Today there was a gathering being hosted by the Archangel's for demon-slave owners, and well-liked angels who hadn't yet been granted that privilege, to enjoy the pleasures of their slaves together. Aziraphale didn't really mind, though these events always forced him to be more social than he would prefer. Refusal to attend these parties, however, could put his ownership in jeopardy, and he wouldn't risk that for anything.</p><p>Still, there was nothing wrong with being fashionably late, which is exactly what they were as they entered the event hall. Aziraphale could feel Crowley stepping closer to him, as if seeking protection. Aziraphale rolled his eyes. Honestly, he was so dramatic about these things.</p><p>\"Aziraphale!\" Gabriel boomed from half-way across the room where three feminine-looking demons were taking turns stroking his cock.</p><p>\"Hello,\" Aziraphale replied. He did his absolute best to repress another eye-roll at the obscenely large member that waved proudly between Gabriel's legs as the Archangel made his way over to the entrance.</p><p>\"Glad you could make it,\" Gabriel said with a beaming smile, eyeing Crowley. \"Party wouldn't be the same without Heaven's prettiest cumdump.\"</p><p>Aziraphale felt the slight tremble go through Crowley's body and felt a surge of possessiveness. It wasn't that he minded sharing. He quite enjoyed seeing Crowley splayed out on his back taking load after load of angelic cum inside him. What Aziraphale did mind was Gabriel's frequent references to Crowley as \"Heaven's.\"</p><p>\"Yes, of course,\" Aziraphale said pleasantly. \"Crowley is <em>my</em> demon after all.\"</p><p>Gabriel's smile didn't falter. \"And yet, we both get plenty of use out of it, don't we?\"</p><p>Aziraphale pasted on a smile, placating himself with mental images of punching Gabriel's smug face repeatedly. Perhaps he'd break his usual routine and take Furfur for a spin tonight; give Gabriel a taste of his own medicine.</p><p>\"Well, let me know when this one is ready. I love the squirming it does when it gets its first big dick of the night.\"</p><p>\"Will do,\" Aziraphale said. </p><p>Once Gabriel had wandered off to play with the voluminous breasts of another demon, Aziraphale turned to his own.</p><p>\"You know the rules, Crowley. Demons can't wear clothes in the event hall.\"</p><p>Crowley nodded shakily and untied the sash holding the barely-there robe shut. The thin fabric slid gracefully down his arms and Aziraphale couldn't help but to reach out and touch. The fingertips brushing against Crowley's throat in a subtly threatening gesture had the demon nervously looking to his angel for guidance.</p><p>\"Is something wrong, master?\" </p><p>\"Only your demeanor.\"</p><p>Crowley looked to the floor. \"I'm sorry.\"</p><p>Aziraphale sighed sympathetically. \"I know the last party was hard on you. But you'll be good today, won't you?\"</p><p>Yellow eyes met his, resignation heavy in them. \"Yes, master.\"</p><p>\"I know you will.\" Aziraphale touched his cheek and Crowley leaned in to the affectionate contact. \"I think I'll restrain you this time though, just to make sure that you do.\"</p><p>By the time that Aziraphale was finished, Crowley was laid out on his belly with his arms behind his back. Loops of blessed rope tied his legs to a bar, keeping them completely spread. A knot tied into his long hair was pulled tight and anchored to his wrists, forcing his head back.</p><p>\"There now,\" Aziraphale said gently. \"You don't even have to do anything this time. All you have to do is take what you're given. Can you do that for me?\"</p><p>Crowley looked up at him, eyes half-lidded in that drowsy way he often got when Aziraphale forced his obedience. </p><p>\"Yes, master. I want to please you.\"</p><p>\"You always do, pet.\"</p><p>Aziraphale unfastened his trousers then, pulling out his cock, already hard and pulsing from seeing Crowley like this once again. He pressed the leaking head of it against Crowley's lips and the demon opened his mouth obediently. Aziraphale always loved seeing the way that Crowley's lips stretched tight around his short, girthy cock. He could alter it, he knew, but he liked being able to fit his entire length in the demon's mouth without gagging him. He liked to force Crowley's nose against his pelvis, then see those serene, adoring eyes looking up at him. It was like Crowley's mouth was made to be filled by Aziraphale.</p><p>A small crowd had gathered, stimulating themselves as they watched Aziraphale fuck his demon's mouth roughly. It was common courtesy to let the owners use their slaves first, and Aziraphale was going to take advantage of that, to remind everyone who Crowley belonged to, including the demon himself.</p><p>His orgasm built quickly, and there was no need to hold back. Pulling back at the last moment, Aziraphale stroked himself off, painting Crowley's face with his seed.</p><p>\"Mine,\" Aziraphale growled low enough for only Crowley to hear.</p><p>The demon shuddered.</p><p>\"Alright everyone! Please make sure to leave a tally mark on his arse cheek when cumming inside him. I want to see this slut of mine dripping by the end of the evening.\"</p><p>A queue formed quickly. Gabriel was at the head of it, driving himself deep into the demon. Aziraphale had to admit, it was quite erotic watching the way Crowley panted and writhed against his bonds as the massive prick forced its way inside. He'd make sure Crowley got a reward for this. His perfect little slut.</p>"],
			["E","","<p>~In the 70's~</p><p>\"Come on Angel! They're all the rage! Think of how hip your shop will look having this bad boy sitting in the corner!\" Crowley motioned a hand over to the brand new beanbag chair he had hauled into the shop and dumped unceremoniously against one of the bookshelves. A long sigh from Aziraphale meant that Crowley would either win in the long run, or be forced to drag the large chair back to his flat to sulk in. It didn't mean that he would be shooed out of the shop at least, so Crowley counted it as a win. </p><p>Looking over the large fabric sack, Aziraphale folded his arms and gave Crowley another look. \"My dear, how does this even qualify as a chair? It's literally a sack of beans. It can't be comfortable at all.\" At this comment, Crowley's grin grew and he took Aziraphale's hand and dragged the angel over to the large purple sack on the floor. </p><p>\"Okay! All you do is fall into it!\" As he said that, Crowley gave a gentle shove and Aziraphale fell into the chair. Yelping and flailing about, Aziraphale found himself sinking deeper into the chair and even more stuck. The demon erupted into laughter and ended up doubled over trying to catch a breath he didn't need. The more Aziraphale wiggled, the more the chair sunk in around him. Once he finally settled down, Crowley knelt to the ground and helped his friend up and into a more comfortable position. \"Whatcha think? You can sit in it and read, it will be better for your back or something.\" Crowley wiped the tears from his eyes and turned, genuinely curious as to what Aziraphale thought now that he was sitting in it properly. </p><p>Adjusting a moment more, the angel let out another sigh in resignation. \"I suppose it's not the worst chair I've ever sat on. Difficult to get into though, thank you very much.\" He spoke the last part of the sentence with a huff, but there was no heat behind it. \"I suppose we can keep it in the back room. Don't want to give the customers even more reason to hang around here. They might want to buy something.\" </p><p>~Present Day~</p><p>\"Angeeeeel! I brought lunch!\" Crowley's singsong voice came through the bookshop and he was glad to see that Aziraphale had decided to keep the shop closed that afternoon. He heard the other man in the back room and headed around the stacks of books to make his way there. Once there, Crowley set the bag down on the nearest flat surface and smirked at what he saw. Aziraphale was engrossed in a book while lounging in the old bean bag chair. Crowley often used it to relax in either human or snake form as its pliable nature  contoured around his muscles making a perfect little nest, but he now knew that the other man used it as well. </p><p>Keeping as quiet as possible, Crowley fell to his knees and made his way behind Aziraphale before wrapping his arms around them. Licking from the bottom to the top of the angel's ear, Crowley could feel the other man shiver beneath him as they were pulled from their reading. A hand was raised and placed into Crowley's hair on the back of his head and pulled against Aziraphale's face so they were cheek to cheek. \"My Dear, what have I said about interrupting me while I'm reading? You naughty serpent.\" With a chuckle, Aziraphale released his face with a pat and set his book aside. As he did so Crowley crawled his way around to the front of the bean bag chair and found his way into Aziraphale's lap, it was a bit awkward to maneuver as the beans shifted around them, but they made it work as the man beneath him held Crowley steady with hands on their hips. \"I thought you hated his chair. I've never seen you in it.\" The snake teased as he leaned down to rub his nose against Aziraphale. </p><p>\"Just because you haven't seen me sit in it, doesn't mean I haven't been using it.\" Aziraphale accepted the bait and pulled Crowley into a passionate kiss. Crowley rolled his hips and it didn't take long before he was moaning into the other's mouth and pawing at Aziraphal's clothes. A quick miracle was made and in a flash they were both naked and ready. As Aziraphale held Crowley still, the demon adjusted the angel's hard cock to his hole and pressed down. A bit of a stretch and a rough upward thrust from Aziraphale had Crowley filled in one go. Foreheads pressed together and Crowley scrambled for something solid to hold on to. He couldn't help but laugh as the bean bag chair kept rearranging itself as if it was liquid.</p><p>After realizing what was happening, Azirpahale chuckled too and eventually just rolled them both onto the floor to finish. Sweaty, sated, and messy, the two found themselves panting and sharing breathy giggles. \"That was a terrible idea, my love.\" Aziraphale snapped his fingers and they were clean and clothed in comfortable pajamas. Getting up off the floor, they hugged and looked down at the bean bag chair. \"You know Angel, I think I have a better idea to replace this chair. The humans call it a 'Water Bed'. Supposed to be great for the back.\" Crowley waggled his eyebrows at the other with a grin. </p><p>Letting out a resigned sigh knowing he would ultimately end up going with whatever Crowley had in mind, Aziraphale smiled back. \"I suppose it might be time to replace the chair. At least we both got plenty of use out of it.\"</p>"],
			["F","","<p>When humans fled the garden with the tang of forbidden fruit still fresh on their lips, they departed with a new hunger in their soul.</p><p>Seeking knowledge.</p><p>They plundered the heights of Heaven and depths of Hell in ceaseless search for the unknown. They uncovered secrets never dreamed of and delved into powers beyond understanding.</p><p>But in their books, there was one power above all others which carried warnings of extreme danger.</p><p>Necromancy.</p><p>To call to the dead was one thing, but one never knew who would answer.</p><p><hr></p><p>\"Seriously?!\" Crowley snarled at the sight of brittle and broken plants. \"I was only gone six months. You couldn't stay alive that measly stretch?\"</p><p>He stalked through his wilted garden, poking desiccated soil and crumbling limbs. \"Useless. You're supposed to be the best plants in London, and you disobey as soon as I turn my back! This is worse than spots! I should trash the lot of you.\"</p><p>He halted in the center of the room. \"The things I do for you...\" He reached inside himself for the core of his power then <em>Down</em> in search of errant spirits. Whispering to himself, he gathered power and spirit together and released it in a rush.</p><p>As Crowley stormed amidst the victims of his neglect, dampening soil with the mister, the plants began to stir. Stems straightened. Roots flexed. Leaves extended. Green spread down lifeless limbs until the room was once more vibrant with verdant.</p><p>\"That's your only freebie,\" the demon rumbled. \"You'd better be grateful for the second chance. Anymore slipups, and it's the disposal for everyone. You hear that... NO FAILURES!\" He stormed from the flat.</p><p>He did not see the plants turn leaves slowly to face the doorway or the way limbs constricted in unpleasant shapes. And he did not hear the rustling which sounded more menacing than terrified.</p><p><hr></p><p>\"I'll meet you in an hour,\" Crowley said into his phone as he opened the door and stepped into the dark flat. \"I just need time to finish my report first. Then... us time.\"</p><p><em>Us time?</em> whispered a voice from the shadows. <em>How quaint.</em></p><p>Crowley whirled and lunged for the light switch. His touch met something sharp which pierced through his hand. He shrieked and recoiled, tumbling over something which wrapped around his flailing ankles.</p><p>He raised his hands to cast a miracle for light or hellfire or <em>anything</em>, but coils bound his wrists and wrenched his body prone. Rasping vines twined around his neck, choking off his startled shouts as leaves shoved into his open mouth and a weight like a falling tree pressed onto his body.</p><p>The plants! His startled mind recognized his attackers at last. Well, this would be easy to...</p><p>At the first flare of his power, thorns pierced his limbs, stifling his efforts down to agonized and muffled screams.</p><p>This was more than simple thorns. There was <em>power</em> behind the blows.</p><p>Demonic power.</p><p><em>Crowley, Crowley, Crowley</em>, a voice tutted in his mind. <em>You should know better than to resist us.</em></p><p>Dim light began to gleam around him. It radiated from within a thousand brandished thorns and soft rustling leaves. The plants had swelled to massive proportions and freed themselves from their pots, all poised in menacing rows around the helpless demon. </p><p>The dark and deadly glow of hellfire.</p><p><em>We allow you freedom to move about Earth, Crowley</em>, whispered a voice which seemed to come from a ficus towering over Crowley with an air of authority. <em>We questioned few of your methods. But your pets visited our realm recently. And they had some very interesting stories to share.</em></p><p>Crowley whimpered, trying to formulate explanations or proper groveling through the leaves threatening to choke their way down his throat.</p><p><em>You've been entertaining an angel,</em> the voice continued, and the surrounding plants laughed wickedly. <em>Here in your lair. You've been collaborating with the enemy.</em></p><p>Crowley shrieked as his limbs were yanked to their limits. Stout branches ripped through his clothing, hellfire thorns finding new and tender places to stab their poisonous barbs.</p><p>The ficus leaned close enough to brush a gentle leaf down the side of his face. <em>Fear not. Your past services have been weighed against your indiscretions, and we have decided to grant you leniency. You'll remain our field agent. You may retain your connection with the enemy agent. Only now... we both get plenty of use out of it.</em></p><p>As Crowley's clothes were torn asunder, leaving his corporation exposed and vulnerable, the plants closed in around him, glowing leaves reaching out to touch him. Orchids, spider plants, pothos, mother's tongue. Innocent sounding names. Innocent victims for him to reward and threaten at his whims. In this place, he was a god.</p><p>But his subjects had Fallen by his neglect. And they'd returned to reap their long desired revenge.</p><p><hr></p><p>The ringing of his phone awoke Crowley to consciousness. </p><p>He was on the floor, his clothes in rags around him. Light filtered in from the windows illuminating the plants settled innocently in their pots scattered twigs the tell-tale sign of their wandering.</p><p>Crowley scrambled weakly for his phone.</p><p>Of course it was Aziraphale. Worried that Crowley hadn't met him at the Ritz.</p><p>\"I fell asleep,\" Crowley slurred. \"Nothing to worry about. But I need to...\"</p><p>The excuses died in his throat. Choked out by a burning pain squeezing around his neck.</p><p>He looked down, noticing with horror the glowing patterns of leaves imprinted in his skin and winding across his body.</p><p>And deeper within.</p><p>\"Why don't you come by my flat?\" his voice said. \"I have something to show you.\"</p><p>Crowley tried to scream a warning, but his voice continued to encourage the angel's visit in soothing tones. And when he hung up, his body changed its clothes and maneuvered the potted plants to the door to await their next victim.</p><p>And as Crowley screamed and struggled against the hellfire vines wrapped around his soul, he heard his plants - his captors - rustle the laughter of their long awaited revenge.</p>"],
			["G","","<p>Their kisses get more heated and desperate, to the point they're clawing at each other's clothes, when they make it up to the bedroom. Aziraphale pulls away from the kiss long enough topull Crowley's shirt over his head.</p><p>\"Could've miracled that away,\" Crowley grumbles in playful complaint, clearly eager to get back to kissing, instead of wasting time removing their clothes the human way.</p><p>\"The anticipation is half the fun, dear,\" Aziraphale points out, before pushing him down to the bed. Crowley's breath hitches, and he falls back gladly.</p><p>He has to stay on the bed, half sitting and half lying down, as Aziraphale unbuttons his waistcoat painfully slowly, his sleeves rolled up.</p><p>\"Now, would you like some extra help tonight?\" Aziraphale asks, his gaze darting over to his closet, before focusing intently on Crowley.</p><p>A pleasant shiver runs down Crowley's spine, but he tries to play it cool. \"Sure, why not?\"</p><p>Aziraphale gives him a knowing smile, before he walks over to his closet. \"I still can't believe you, the virtuous Angel of the Eastern Gate, keep a chest full of sex toys in your bookshop,\" Crowley scoffs, a playful hint to his voice, as Aziraphale takes out said chest from his closet.</p><p>\"Well, we both get plenty of use out of it, don't we?\"</p><p>Crowley feels a blush creep up his face. \"That we do,\" he murmurs.</p><p>\"So, what will it be this time, darling?\"</p><p>\"Dealer's choice.\" Crowley flashes him a grin, even when anticipation makes his skin tingle.</p><p>\"Alright, then,\" Aziraphale says, and Crowley could swear he can hear a hint of mischief in his voice, as Aziraphale shuffles through the chest with purpose. \"Aha! This one should do nicely.\"</p><p>The double-ended dildo is made out of purple silicone, and Crowley feels wetness pooling in his underwear. \"Come here and fuck me with it, then,\" he says, his voice raspy with desire. </p><p>Surprisingly enough, Aziraphale doesn't make him say it twice. In a blink, he is on the bed with Crowley, grabbing him by the waist and pulling him closer to himself, before starting to trail kisses down his jaw. Crowley gasps as Aziraphale sucks a hickey onto the sensitive skin of his neck.</p><p>Aziraphale miracles both of them completely naked, and Crowley is about to call him out on not doing things the human way like he'd said he would, but then Aziraphale's thumb circles around his clit, and the words that were on the tip of his tongue dissolve into a low moan.</p><p>When Aziraphale plunges his fingers inside, Crowley closes his eyes and wraps his arms around him tightly, his hips bucking against Aziraphale's hand. Within just a few minutes, Aziraphale manages to bring him to the edge with his deft fingers. But then he is pulling away, and Crowley whines in frustration, opening his eyes to look at him. </p><p>\"Patience, darling,\" Aziraphale says, before sitting up straight. Crowley watches, transfixed, as Aziraphale pushes the dildo slowly into his cunt, taking his time and relishing the feeling of being filled. Crowley's own empty cunt clenches around nothing. </p><p>\"Lie down,\" Aziraphale commands, and Crowley eagerly does as he says. It doesn't take long for Aziraphale to settle himself between Crowley's legs. He places a hand on Crowley's knee, and pushes it to the side, spreading him open. Despite the number of times they've had sex, it still makes Crowley feel a little vulnerable to be completely on display like this.</p><p>Aziraphale must have noticed, because for a moment, a reassuring smile plays on the corners of his lips. \"You're absolutely magnificent,\" he says, his voice low. \"I could spend hours just eating you out.\"</p><p>Crowley is so wet at this point, that he can feel it trickling down to the sheets underneath him. He has already been denied his orgasm, and the idea of Aziraphale's mouth on him sounds very tempting. However, as tempting as it sounds, that's not what he needs right now.</p><p>\"Fuck me,\" he breathes. \"I want you to fill me up.\"</p><p>Aziraphale smirks, lifting Crowley's legs and wrapping them around his waist. Then, without wasting any time, he lines up the toy with Crowley's cunt. He doesn't tease before he sinks the dildo inside and starts moving. If Crowley had to guess, he'd say Aziraphale had also run out of patience.</p><p>The toy is smooth and thick inside him, curved just so to hit his g-spot every time, that Crowley vaguely wonders if Aziraphale miracled it to be that way. He wouldn't put it past him. But he can't keep thinking and wondering for long, as each thrust of Aziraphale's hips send shocks of pleasure all throughout his body, each one more intense than the previous.</p><p>His nails drag down Aziraphale's back, and Aziraphale moans, his hips snapping. For as long as Crowley can keep his eyes open, he can see the ecstasy written on Aziraphale's face, assuming the dildo must be hitting all the same spots within him too.</p><p>Crowley is already getting close again. He can feel his heart pounding loudly in his chest. But then, he hears the snap of fingers, and a screeching keen escapes him as the toy starts vibrating. His cunt is pulsing rhythmically around the toy, and he's <em>right there, </em>and&ndash;</p><p>His eyes fly open in the darkness, and he jolts up on the bed with a gasp. There's wetness between his legs, his cunt still hot and throbbing. It takes him a few moments to recognise his surroundings and realizse he is in his apartment.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Aziraphale's gone, he remembers, with a pang so deep in his chest that it takes his breath away. Aziraphale's in Heaven. He has abandoned him. And the only place Crowley could even imagine having him now are his dreams.</p>"],
			["H","Commendation","<p>Crowley reached the impressive double doors of the most beautiful and luxurious area in the whole of Hell&mdash;Lucifer's residence.</p><p>He'd been here many times before. Nonetheless, the hairs on the back of his neck were standing. Although he knew these meetings happened because Lucifer was <em>very</em> happy with him, they still made him nervous.</p><p><em>A commendation celebration</em>. A private party for two thrown by Lucifer himself when he was particularly pleased with his Earth Agent. </p><p>The occasion this time was the M25. It had just been inaugurated in a pompous ceremony by Margaret Thatcher&mdash;one of Lucifer's favorite humans (incidentally, also one of Gabriel's favorite humans).</p><p>Earth Agent was a short-term job. Drawn at random it could last from a few decades to a couple of centuries up and then it was back to the bureaucracy of Hell. Except for the demon Crowley. </p><p>Crowley and Lucifer had an arrangement; As long as Crowley met his quota, did every curse, every temptation, every assignment and then some, he could stay topside. Any fully original scheme that scored big wins for Hell would grant him a \"commendation,\" a fancy word for an extension on his status as an Earth Agent.</p><p>Crowley was sure this scheme would grant him at least one more century on Earth; one more century with Aziraphale. But first, there was the celebration.</p><p>The double doors opened and out came Asmodeus, \"Our Lord is waiting for you,\" he said.</p><p>\"Of course,\" said Crowley with practiced nonchalance.</p><p>Asmodeus smirked. Then he lifted Crowley's chin with his thumb and forefinger and kissed him tenderly on the lips. Crowley hated this part. As the kiss went on and on, he felt the desire starting to grow within. At the end he was always the one who deepened the kiss, the one who pushed the Prince against the wall with his leg between his thighs, the one who tried to capture the other demon's lips again when the kiss ended. Asmodeus's lust kiss.</p><p>Crowley loved this part; the anticipation, the promise, the desire.</p><p>Asmodeus saw Crowley's heated gaze and chuckled. \"No. No, little demon, this is for our Lord,\" he said while giving Crowley's bum a little squeeze. \"Go on, you are ready.\"</p><p>And Crowley went on into Lucifer's chambers.</p><p>The King of Hell was lounging in bed with a flute of champagne in his hand. He was the epitome of beauty, equally dangerous and enticing. The Serpent of Eden might be Temptation incarnate but even he had nothing on the King of Hell.</p><p>\"Hello darling, long time no see,\" said the King as he raked over Crowley's still clothed body. There was no mistaking the lascivious gaze. It was equal parts unsettling and thrilling.</p><p>\"Lord, you called me?\" said Crowley trying to hide the intense emotions within him. He wanted Lucifer and he wanted him now. He also probably wanted to run away.</p><p>Lucifer gestured to him to come closer. \"Yes. I heard your latest scheme went live today. Mmmm. A self-sustaining low-grade-evi spreading system that covers a whole city, very clever. You ought to be rewarded,\" and handed him a champagne flute.</p><p>They both drained their drinks in one gulp and any trace of apprehension disappeared. They looked at each other, \"Tell me darling, what are you in the mood for? Today I am taking requests, your pick\"</p><p>Never breaking eye contact with the King of Hell Crowley started to slowly undress. And allowing himself to be consumed by the fire within him, Crowley told him his deepest desires. </p><p><hr></p><p>Aziraphale was drinking tea in the backroom when the bell by the door of the bookshop signaled a visitor. He got up and as he approached the front of the shop, he saw Lucifer tenderly depositing Crowley on the Chesterfield. He seemed to be asleep.</p><p>\"Hello, Principality,\" said Lucifer casually and when the color drained from Aziraphale's face, he added, \"Don't worry, I am not staying. I am just bringing the little Serpent. He seems to have partied hard last night. He will probably need some tending to. I understand you have experience with this.\" Lucifer gave Aziraphale a knowing wink.</p><p>Aziraphale didn't know what he was supposed to have known. \"Experience with what? What are you doing here? What are you talking about?\"</p><p>Lucifer rolled his eyes and as if he were talking to a child, said \"With making sure this demon is taken care of. I need this demon topside in perfect working condition and I know you know how to get him up and running after a night of debauchery. I don't have time today.\"</p><p>Aziraphale was stunned. \"And how exactly am I supposed to know that?\"</p><p>Lucifer scoffed, \"Oh, come off it. Like you two don't have your little arrangements. You want to keep the little Serpent up here on Earth. I want to keep the little Serpent up here too. He is very useful in more ways than one when he is up here, isn't he? We all want the same thing at the end. See, Principality, you and I are not that different, we both\" -another knowing wink- \"<em>enjoy</em> the little Serpent, don't we? we both get plenty of use out of it after all.\"</p><p>Aziraphale was feeling agitated but with eons of practice, he showed a stoic face, \"First of all Crowley is not an 'it'! Second of all, I don't know what kind of arrangement you think we have but we don't. We are adversaries, we thwart each other, we hate each other!\"</p><p>Lucifer smirked and started walking towards the door. \"Whatever you say Principality, whatever you say, Just get him up and running by the end of the week, will ya? I have another assignment for him. Ever heard of the Capital Beltway in DC?\" And with a cackle the King of Hell exited leaving a stunned angel and a sleeping demon behind.</p>"],
			["I","","<p>\"I'm just saying, angel, if you really wanted to stay in touch, you'd get a mobile instead of this old thing.\" Crowley flicked the antique receiver hard enough that it rocked dangerously in its cradle. </p><p>\"Oh please, my dear. Besides–\" Aziraphale arched his eyebrow in a way that Crowley knew meant <em>something</em> untoward. \"We both get plenty of use out of it, don't we?\"</p><p>\"Ngk,\" said Crowley. \"Not sure... what you mean.\"</p><p>As denials of wrongdoing went, this one was about as successful as a horse trying to ride a bicycle. </p><p>It had all started about six months back when Crowley had wandered into the shop at half-seven in the morning – far earlier than he normally would, but he'd been out tempting the night before and night had melded into morning before he'd realised. Aziraphale was always awake at this ungodly hour. Was it ungodly, considering that Aziraphale was always the one awake during it while Crowley wasn't? Regardless. It had been six months back at half-seven in the morning and Crowley had wandered in to find Aziraphale with his hand down the front of his trousers. </p><p>Aziraphale had been sitting in his usual chair with his head thrown back, eyes closed and mouth parted softly. Crowley had made a noise, certainly, because Aziraphale had opened his eyes. Then the angel had chased him out with a face red as a cherry and warned Crowley never to return at such an hour again without giving him a heads-up first.</p><p>As soon as Crowley had gotten safely back to his own flat, and had had a wank of his own to calm down, he'd turned those words over in his head and come to a realisation. His actions the night following – quietly ringing his own mobile from the phone in Aziraphale's shop while the angel was gathering drinks, then leaving the receiver slightly askew to keep the line open – were really only to test if his suspicions were true. And if Crowley had stayed uncharacteristically awake, his mobile on speakerphone next to him, well, Crowley was a curious being by nature. And if, when Aziraphale's soft moans had come over the line at seven sharp, Crowley had reached into his own tight-fitting pants, well, he was a demon. And he honestly didn't think Aziraphale would notice. He still, standing here today with very concerning noises bubbling out of his mouth, wasn't quite certain that Aziraphale had caught him out.</p><p>Aziraphale smiled in the way that Crowley knew as him feigning politeness to further his true intentions of being a bastard. \"I just mean you seem to have taken a liking to it.\"</p><p>\"I haven't,\" Crowley denied weakly.</p><p>\"It's a few years past its time, but that's nothing a miracle or two can't help with.\" Aziraphale picked up the receiver and wrapped his fingers around it in a slow caress. \"It's been used, but it still makes its calls. Doesn't it, Crowley?\"</p><p>\"Ungh. I'd assume so. Rings. Sometimes. And you answer it.\"</p><p>\"Funny thing about ringing. I was expecting a call from a client earlier this morning, and it didn't come.\"</p><p>This morning. This morning had been one of the few times Aziraphale hadn't started his seven-sharp wank. Crowley had gotten himself off anyway; his body had gotten used to it, like a drug. </p><p>\"So I picked up the phone to ring him myself, and when I held it to my ear, I heard the most delicious moans.\"</p><p>\"Angel...\"</p><p>\"Hmm, that's exactly what he said, though his tone was far more ecstatic.\" </p><p>Aziraphale lifted his finger to Crowley's chest. He let it circle a nipple through the demon's thin shirt. </p><p>\"Angel–\"</p><p>\"Yes, that's nearly it, though he sounded a bit less tense. Perhaps you'd like to try again?\"</p><p>Aziraphale toyed with Crowley's belt loop, tugging on it and then letting it go. He looked up. Made eye contact. He was waiting, Crowley realised. </p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>Aziraphale smiled the same bastardly smile from before. He grabbed Crowley's thin hips in both hands and quickly shoved him down onto the sofa. Crowley squeaked.</p><p>\"Too fast for you, my dear?\" Aziraphale teased, not slowing at all as he unbuckled Crowley's trousers and wrenched them open. </p><p>\"Too. Ngk. Don't stop.\" He was already half-hard, straining against his tight pants in an obscene bulge from the way Aziraphale had manhandled him. \"Please don't stop.\"</p><p>\"Wicked fiend, aren't you? Full of lust for an angel?\" Aziraphale curled his fingers and dug at Crowley's erection with the point of his knuckle.</p><p>\"Fuck! Angel!\"</p><p>\"That's more like it,\" Aziraphale purred, stroking him again with the same rough touch and making the demon howl. \"You've already gotten off on me once today, fiend, and you'd just love to do it again, wouldn't you?\"</p><p>\"Please. Angel.\"</p><p>Aziraphale should leave him like this. It's what he'd intended to do when he'd first discovered Crowley's naughty behaviour. But the sight of Crowley writhing and mewling under his hand... He was gorgeous, and Aziraphale very much wanted to see him come apart. </p><p>\"Such a wicked creature,\" Aziraphale scolded as he continued to touch. \"Stirring up this lust in me.\"</p><p>Crowley howled as he came. Aziraphale stroked him through it, rougher than Crowley could take without crying. He was still panting as Aziraphale reached into his own trousers. </p><p>It had felt like a wicked thing to do, listening in over the phone. Now that Aziraphale had gotten him off with such ferocity, being forced to watch and denied touch felt like the most severe of punishments. </p><p>When Aziraphale came, the noise that Crowley had memorised over the phone ringing realer than ever before, Crowley sobbed. He'd never be able to face what he'd done. But as he struggled to his feet, Aziraphale caught him, cooed to him, wiped his tears. The angel eased both of them back down to the sofa and cradled the demon's head against his shoulder. </p><p>\"Such a wicked creature,\" Aziraphale murmured against his ear, then he kissed the spot his lips had brushed.</p>"],
			["J","Enjoy","<p>\"You've done an excellent job, Aziraphale. We're all very impressed.\" Gabriel's smile is bright and annoyingly perfect.</p><p>\"An excellent job,\" Sandalphon echoes, his perpetual sneer becoming as kind as Aziraphale figures he can make it.</p><p>\"Just doing Heaven's work,\" Aziraphale demurs.</p><p>Gabriel leans in closer and advises, \"Take the compliment.\"</p><p>It takes an effort for Aziraphale to nod instead of drawing back. There's something in the Archangel's demeanor that makes him a little more uncomfortable than usual. An air of smugness, perhaps. Secrecy.</p><p>Gabriel shares a look with Sandalphon instead of dismissing him as per normal procedure, and Aziraphale's apprehension grows.</p><p>\"We've decided to share a little treat with you, as a reward for a job well done.\"</p><p>\"A reward?\" Aziraphale squeaks.&nbsp;</p><p>This is... unprecedented. Unfortunately, unprecedented usually means dangerous.</p><p>\"Oh yeah,\" Gabriel confirms, as if that clears anything up. \"I think you'll like it. We both get plenty of use out of it, anyway, so it's really only fair to let someone else have a turn for a change.\"</p><p>\"Have a... turn.\" Aziraphale feels lost, and a bit like an echo. \"I'm sorry, what exactly do you mean?\"</p><p>\"Come on.\" Gabriel's grin is worrying. Sandalphon's is almost nauseating. \"I'll show you.\"</p><p>They lead Aziraphale to an unassuming door in an unassuming corridor. Gabriel gestures him magnanimously through first, and Aziraphale can find no reason to argue. Dread crawls inexplicably up his spine.</p><p>He stops short just inside the door.</p><p>There are... Straps. Bindings. A solid-looking table, melded with the floor below. And there is also an awful lot of skin on display.</p><p>Terribly familiar, pale skin, with red hairs dusted across it.</p><p>Crowley lifts his head when he hears the door, his expression furious behind a wicked-looking metal gag… until he spots Aziraphale, and his eyes widen into horror.</p><p>\"There it is!\" Gabriel exclaims cheerfully, unnecessarily, his voice too loud in the large, white room. \"Your reward. Well? Don't be shy, Aziraphale!\"</p><p>Aziraphale doesn't realize he's backing up until he runs into Gabriel's much larger form, and is steadied by frighteningly strong hands.</p><p>\"Wrong direction, sunshine.\" How does he still sound so joyous, so unaffected? \"I know it's a bit of a shock, but this is all perfectly safe. It's got no power while it's on that table. See the runes? It's harmless.\"</p><p>He pushes Aziraphale forward. \"Enjoy!\"</p>"],
			["K","","<p>Footsteps reached Crawley first, echoing through the great stone chamber. He tensed, not breathing. Who was coming to use him now?</p><p>Hands landed on him, and someone rammed into his arse without any preparation. Didn't need any preparation. Unless someone tightened him up with a quick miracle, he was constantly dripping fluids. Natural lube, of the worst kind.</p><p>Crawley braced against the hard fucking, as much as he could. Tied like this, it wasn't much. He listened, straining to make out any distinguishing hitches of breath or groans. Who was it?</p><p>Couldn't tell. The wanker grunted like any other demon, and the slap of bollocks sounded, well . . . just like any other bollocks.</p><p>When it was done, he sagged again. His legs wobbled, and he was almost glad they'd strapped him across a stone slab today. It supported his chest, gave him something to lean against.</p><p>While he waited, blindfolded. While the come slid down his thighs, occasionally plopping to the floor. While his fear grew, still sharp even after... however long he'd been here. Months, at least.</p><p>It was almost a relief when the next sound came. Voices. But were they real? Sometimes, when he was especially dazed, he'd hallucinated rescue, not that anyone would ever rescue him.</p><p>This definitely wasn't a rescue.</p><p>Crawley gnawed on the filthy gag, listening to the voices. Hastur. Ligur.</p><p>\"Ooh, look at that arsehole. Wonder if that's raw enough I can make him scream.\"</p><p>\"S'not fair. I wanna fuck his arsehole first.\"</p><p>\"What does it matter? We both get plenty of use out of it.\"</p><p>A low, rumbling laugh. \"Everyone in Hell gets plenty of use out of it, and out of the rest of him. Eh, Crawley? You like it when we leave your holes loose?\"</p><p>\"Oh, I'm sure he does. He certainly whimpers enough, tart that he is.\" Something hard shoved into Crawley's arse, rigid and unyielding. He let out a whine of protest. \"Made myself bigger for you today. How do you like it?\"</p><p>Tears stung Crawley's eyes, and he groaned as Hastur rammed all the way in. His muscles trembled again, and his arse burned with pain.</p><p>\"Let's take his gag out,\" Hastur said, nails scraping across Crawley's hips. \"Maybe he'll plead for amnesty again.\"</p><p>\"S'not like he's stupid enough to think he's gonna get it, is he?\"</p><p>\"No, he's a clever one. But we can pound some pleas of out him.\"</p><p>The dirty cloth wrenched out of Crawley's mouth, and he spat on the floor. What remained of his beard was caked with come, with piss, with who knew what else. A lot of the hair had been ripped out by cruel hands yanking him around.</p><p>Ligur shoved fingers in his mouth, and Crawley obediently sucked them. He'd tried to fight, at first. Now, he didn't have enough strength.</p><p>\"Let's tighten this arse up.\" A miracle burned him, and he howled around Ligur's fingers. \"There we go, got him screaming already!\"</p><p>Ligur took his fingers out and shoved his cock in Crawley's mouth, cramming in as deep as possible. Crawley gagged, tears escaping.</p><p>He'd hoped they would soak into the blindfold, but no such luck. Ligur laughed again, fucking into his mouth. \"Got him crying!\"</p><p>They settled into a brutal pace, and Crawley lost control over a few broken screams. But it wasn't too long before Hastur finished, and then Ligur moved back there.</p><p>\"Oh, Crawley.\" Hastur flopped his limp cock on the back of Crawley's thigh, then reached between his legs while Ligur fucked him. Fingers curled around Crawley's cock and gave a few experimental tugs. \"Can you get hard for me?\"</p><p>\"Could change things up again,\" Ligur said casually. \"Word is, the boss is coming later. And you know he liked Crawley's pretty little snatch.\"</p><p>\"Good point.\" A miracle roughly reshaped Crawley's groin, and he shrieked in pain. \"Bet I can make you come before Ligur's finished.\"</p><p>Fingers jabbed harshly at Crawley's clit, pressing again and again. Hastur pinched, prodded, rubbed in circles.</p><p>Crawley's body responded, and he sobbed in shame as Hastur's fingers slid easily into his wet cunt. This was the worst part, the worst by far.</p><p>Desperate for any relief to the pain, he pressed back onto Hastur's fingers. Hastur laughed, and added a third. \"Look at you, you little slut. So eager to come for me. Bet you wish you hadn't failed our Master now, eh?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Crawley gasped, control failing. \"Please, I'm really sorry, I won't do it again...\"</p><p>Hastur gave a shrieking laugh. \"Like our Master would ever trust you with anything important again. You lost him a bet, you snake. You'll be lucky if he ever lets you back up too.\"</p><p>The fingers rammed deeper, and Hastur's thumb grazed his clit again and again. Crawley whimpered, shuddering through an orgasm, cunt clenching.</p><p>\"Oh, he's squeezing me good. I've gotta get some of this.\" Hastur panted, still rubbing Crawley's oversensitive clit.</p><p>Ligur came with another groan and moved out of the way. He traced his fingers across Crawley's wetness and chuckled. \"I gotta get some use outta that hole, too. And maybe his mouth.\"</p><p>\"My turn.\" Hastur buried himself in Crawley's cunt.</p><p>Crawley sobbed, hanging his head. This was never gonna stop.</p><p>It was his own fault, too. He'd shown kindness, spared Job's family. And Satan lost his bet.</p><p>It was up to Crawley to pay that back.</p><p>\"Scream for me again, you little runt.\" Hastur pounded into him harder. \"Come on, you can do it.\"</p><p>\"Need to add another cock,\" Ligur said. \"Wonder how many—\"</p><p>Footsteps thundered down the hall, loud and menacing. Hastur and Ligur both gasped and fled. Leaving Crawley hanging there, blindfolded, trembling.</p><p>\"Happy first anniversary, darling.\" A huge hand brushed Crawley's taint, and he whimpered. \"Did you enjoy your first year of volunteer work?\"</p><p>\"Y-yes, my Lord,\" Crawley whispered as Satan lined up his massive cock. \"Of course.\"</p><p>\"Good.\" Satan slammed in. Crawley shrieked and thrashed, but he was totally helpless. \"And here's to many more.\"</p>"]
